1. Features
The Study Buddy Finder offers a range of features to enhance the study experience for users, including:

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profile.
- Calender: Users can add and view study sessions with friends
- Chat: A built-in messaging system allows users to communicate with their study buddies.
- Friend and Profile Management: Users can connect with other students as friends and update their profiles.
- Rating: Can rate other users and view their rating out of 5 stars
- Search: Users can search for other users by name or classes

In this README, we will focus on the "Friend" and "Profile" features.

2. Friend Feature
As the developer responsible for the "Friend" feature, here's what you need to know:

Friend Requests: Users can send friend requests to other users by visiting their profiles.
Accepting/Declining Requests: Users can accept or decline friend requests they receive.
Friends List: Users can view and manage their list of friends.
Unfriending: Users can remove friends from their list if needed.

3. Profile Feature
As the developer responsible for the "Profile" feature, here's what you need to know:

Editing Profile: Users can edit and update their profile information at any time.
Viewing Profiles: Users can view the profiles of other users to learn more about their classes and rating.
Profile Views: There is a public and private profile view, one that you see if you are not friends with the other user, and a different more detailed one after you are their friend. If you are friends with the user you can schedule a study session with them and give them a rating.
